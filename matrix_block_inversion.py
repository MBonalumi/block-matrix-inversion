def matrix_block_inversion(Ainv,B,C,D):
    '''
    This function performs the inverted of a matrix X, defined by blocks as:
    
            X = [A B]
                [C D]
    
    The algorithm performed is Block Matrix Inversion.
    (refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11103.pdf for more information)

    This algorithm requires A and its schur complement S(A) = D-CA'B to be invertible.
    If not, one could use D and its schur complement S(D) = A-BD'C instead, being sure those are invertible.
    In this case call matrix_block_inversion_D instead.

    If A and its Schur complement S are invertible, then the inverse of X is:

            X'= [  A' + A'BS'CA'   -A'BS'  ]
                [     -S'CA'         S'    ]
    
    The advantage is that only the inverse of A and S are required.
    This come in handy when A' is already known.

    For example when expanding the kernel matrix in Gaussian Processes Tenciques.
